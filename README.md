# Multi-Language Coding Documentation Assistant  
*A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System*

This project implements a multi-language **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** assistant that consolidates programming documentation from **Python**, **JavaScript/React**, and **MATLAB** into a single, unified tool. By ingesting documentation excerpts, chunking them semantically, embedding them locally for privacy, and storing them in **ChromaDB**, the system retrieves relevant information to ground answers generated by a hosted LLM. Designed for students, researchers, and developers, the assistant provides accurate explanations, code examples, and citations across multiple programming ecosystems. Evaluation on an 18-question test set achieved **83% accuracy**, **94% citation quality**, and an average latency of **3.2 seconds**, demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG for multi-language documentation lookup and cross-language code understanding.

## Features
- Unified lookup across Python, JavaScript/React, and MATLAB  
- Local embeddings for privacy and zero cost  
- Metadata-aware retrieval using ChromaDB  
- High-quality LLM answers with citations  
- Fast responses (≈3 seconds)

## Tech Stack
- **Embeddings:** SentenceTransformers / Instructor (local)  
- **Vector DB:** ChromaDB  
- **LLM:** Hosted GPT model (GPT-4o mini or GPT-3.5)  
- **Pipeline:** Ingestion → Chunking → Embedding → Retrieval → Generation

## Future Improvements
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector)  
- Language classifier for ambiguous queries  
- Reranking for long documentation sections  
- Support for additional languages (C++, Java, Rust)  
- Optional GraphRAG / LightRAG for multi-hop reasoning  
- Automatic documentation syncing
